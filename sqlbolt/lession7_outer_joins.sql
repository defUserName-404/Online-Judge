-- ? Depending on how you want to analyze the data, the INNER JOIN we used last lesson might
-- ? not be sufficient because the resulting table only contains data that belongs in both of the tables.
-- ?
-- ? If the two tables have asymmetric data, which can easily happen when data is entered in different stages,
-- ? then we would have to use a LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN or FULL JOIN instead to ensure that the data you need is not left out of the results.
-- ?
-- ? Select query with LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOINs on multiple tables
-- ? SELECT column, another_column, …
-- ? FROM mytable
-- ?     INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN another_table
-- ? ON mytable.id = another_table.matching_id
-- ? WHERE condition(s)
-- ? ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC
-- ? LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
-- ? Like the INNER JOIN these three new joins have to specify which column to join the data on.
-- ? When joining table A to table B, a LEFT JOIN simply includes rows from A regardless
-- ? of whether a matching row is found in B. The RIGHT JOIN is the same, but reversed, keeping rows
-- ? in B regardless of whether a match is found in A. Finally, a FULL JOIN simply means
-- ? that rows from both tables are kept, regardless of whether a matching row exists in the other table.
-- ?
-- ? When using any of these new joins, you will likely have to write additional logic to deal with
-- ? NULLs in the result and constraints (more on this in the next lesson).
-- ?
-- ? Did you know?
-- ? You might see queries with these joins written as LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, or FULL OUTER JOIN,
-- ? but the OUTER keyword is really kept for SQL-92 compatibility and these queries are simply equivalent
-- ? to LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN respectively.

-- ! EXERCISE
-- ! Find the list of all buildings that have employees
SELECT DISTINCT Building
FROM Employees;
-- ! Find the list of all buildings and their capacity
SELECT Building_name, Capacity
FROM Buildings;
-- ! List all buildings and the distinct employee roles in each building (including empty buildings)
SELECT DISTINCT Building_name, Role
FROM Buildings
         LEFT JOIN Employees
                   ON Buildings.Building_name = Employees.Building;
